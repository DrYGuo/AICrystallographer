Collection of tutorial-style notebooks in Google Colaboratory describing construction and training of deep nerual networks. To run a notebook click on 'Open in Colab' icon. It will then open it in Google Colaboratory, which is a Jupyter notebook environment for machine learning research that requires no setup to use. Just open and start executing (or perhaps use it as a starting point to develop a better network!).

P.S. More notebooks to come soon :)
