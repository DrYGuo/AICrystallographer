To aid in the automated analysis of atomically resolved images, we will upload here our pre-trained Deep Learning models (such as AtomNet, DefectNet, SymmetryNet, etc.) accompanied by the Jupyter notebooks describing how to perform an inference on experimental data. Most of the notebooks can be opened and executed in Google Colaboratory, which is a Jupyter notebook environment for machine learning research that requires no setup to use (and also provides free GPU/TPU).
