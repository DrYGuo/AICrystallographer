Population and distribution of defects is one of the primary parameters controlling materials functionality, are often non-ergodic and strongly dependent on synthesis history, and are rarely amenable to direct theoretical prediction. Here, dynamic electron beam-induced transformations in Si deposited on a graphene monolayer are used to create libraries of the possible Si and carbon vacancy defects. Automated image analysis and recognition based on deep learning networks is developed to identify and enumerate the defects, creating a library of (meta) stable defect configurations. The analysis should also work for other systems (but will require a different training set for a neural network) where a known impurity in a monoatomic host lattice can have many different configurations (e.g. form dimers, trimers, have different number of bonds to the nearby host lattice atoms, etc.). The extension to systems with more than two atomic species will be a subject of future work. <br><br>
The full library of (refined) defects will be available after our paper gets published. More details on the analysis procedure will be added within the next few days.
