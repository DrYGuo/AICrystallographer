# LibraryNet
   Workflow based on a combination of deep neural network and analysis of lattice graph structures for creating a library of Si point defects in graphene. This analysis should also work for other systems (but will require a different training set for a neural network) with a known impurity atom in a host lattice, which can have different configurations, for example, it can form dimers, trimers and tetramers and each impurity atom in a defect complex may have different number of bonds to the nearby host lattice atoms. The workflow is based on our paper in arXiv:1809.04256 but now with an improved (more general) deep learning model written in PyTorch instead of Keras.<br><br>
  <b>This is a jupyter/colab notebook-centric package</b> and therefore the best way to use it is by openning and executing a notebook <b><i>libraries.ipynb</i></b> in Google Colab. If for some reason GitHub doesn't open it after several tries (happened a few times to me), just use [this direct link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pycroscopy/AICrystallographer/blob/master/LibraryNet/libraries.ipynb).<br><br>
  If you wish to work with data and codes via a command line interface (please note that at present moment, options there are a bit limited), first clone the repository and cd into LibraryNet directory. Then, to analyze defect structures in your experimental data and to save results as a library file use ```python test.py <filename.hdf5>```. To view both experimental data (image) and library files (image + detected defects) use ```python plot_from_hdf.py <filename.hdf5>```. It is recommended to try it first on the test files with raw experimental data, which we uploaded to 'test_data' folder.
