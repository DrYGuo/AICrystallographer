**AtomNet**

Example of applying a fully convolutional neural network to locate atoms in noisy experimental scanning transmission electron microscopy data from graphene. Please make sure to go through GrapheneAtomFinder.ipynb for details regarding the model's usage and its limitation. The current model is limited to graphene lattice, but we expect to upload more models for different systems (and update the current one as well) in the near future.
