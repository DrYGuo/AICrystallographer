<font size = 15> <b> SymmetryNet </b>

SymmetryNet is a deep convolutional network used to determine 2D Bravais lattice Symmetry from atomically resolved images. 

We discuss this in our paper <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-018-0086-7#Sec11"> Vasudevan et al., npj Computational materials 4, 30 (2018)</a>

Note that we are currently working on extending this model, to make it more robust against intensity fluctuations. We expect this to be available in late 2019.

The trained keras model should be downloaded <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41524-018-0086-7/MediaObjects/41524_2018_86_MOESM3_ESM.h5"> here</a>, notebook and two test images shown in the paper are provided in this repo.
