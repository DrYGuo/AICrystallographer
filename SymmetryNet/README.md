<font size = 15> <b> SymmetryNet </b>

SymmetryNet is a deep convolutional network used to determine 2D Bravais lattice Symmetry from atomically resolved images. 

We discuss this in our paper <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-018-0086-7#Sec11"> Vasudevan et al., npj Computational materials 4, 30 (2018)</a>

Note that we are currently working on extending this model, to make it more robust against intensity fluctuations.

A trained keras model, notebook and two test images shown in the paper are provided.
